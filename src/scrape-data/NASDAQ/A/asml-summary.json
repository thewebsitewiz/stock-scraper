Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. Chipmakers require next-generation EUV lithography tools from ASML to continue past the 3-nanometer process node."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.asml.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"FrTdTric J.
