This test is performed on pathogens that are commonly associated with serious infections and can deliver results more quickly than traditional methods, such as bacterial culturing. The system can analyze a positive blood culture sample in approximately five hours, which is faster than traditional testing techniques."},"CompanyUrl":{"label":"Company Url","value":"https://www.acceleratediagnostics.com"},"KeyExecutives":{"label":"Key Executives","value":[{"name":"Jack Phillips","title":"President, Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director"}]}},"message":null,"status":{"rCode":200,"bCodeMessage":null,"developerMessage":null}}
